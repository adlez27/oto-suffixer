# OTO Suffixer
Add a suffix to every alias in an OTO.  oto.ini on Windows, oto_ini.txt on Mac, these files contain the timing configurations for UTAU voicebanks.

Download and run OtoSuffixer.jar to use.  Make sure the OTO you want to suffix is in the same folder as the jar. On Windows, you may have to convert the oto to UTF-8.
